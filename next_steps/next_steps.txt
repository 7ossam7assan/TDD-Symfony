The Next Steps Is what I would do in a real job (to be more precise after agreement with business team)


*- I would create the invoice with status pending review (it's the pending request from the creditor)

*- There would be an endpoint to change it to pending (to be paid), and (I started my work from here), and add the invoice price to actual debts table.
 it's called after review process(manually(dashboard admins)/ML-based).

*- Adding endpoint PUT /companies/{company_id}  to adjust the debtor max debt limit, it could be done based on the rate(equation) the debtor paying his debts.

*- Based on the above rate we could have a threshold to block debtor(could make the max allowed debt amount 0 as work-around) also via the above recommended endpoint.

*- If we agreed on the above blocking endpoints the debtor may come later and pay his all debt, and we need to change the max debtor limit or,
 unblock it if agreed on blocking way/


Technical Points to be done

*- Add auth instead of sending companies ids hardcoded.

*- Technical Point upload invoice documents to a file storage service and return the file url from there.

*- Remove feature branches after they are tested & deployed.
